# Fitness-Based Recommender System

## Project Overview
The "Fitness-Based Recommender System" is a machine learning project designed to suggest personalized fitness and nutrition plans based on a user’s health profile. By analyzing factors such as gender, weight, height, and BMI, the system classifies the user's fitness level and provides suitable recommendations to improve their health and lifestyle.

## Features
- Accepts user inputs like gender, weight, height
- Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Classifies users into fitness categories using KNN
- Recommends appropriate fitness and nutrition plans
- Can be extended for real-time web or mobile applications

## Technologies Used
- Python – Core programming language
- Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing
- Scikit-learn – ML model building using KNN
- LabelEncoder – Categorical data encoding
- CSV Files – Dataset storage and loading

## Techniques Applied
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Label Encoding for categorical features
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification
- Feature selection and BMI calculation
- Logic-based recommendation generation

## Dataset
The system uses CSV files:
- 'BMI.CSV' – Contains user BMI data and also contains food/nutrition suggestions based on BMI categories

> Note: Ensure the datasets are clean and consistent before training the model.
